# Changelog

All notable changes to the `mojulo` npm package are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While in `0.x`, the artifact format and bundled bot image are pinned per
control-plane version — a minor bump may move the pinned bot image tag.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

Adds the Next.js dashboard as a second binary in the same npm package. The
launch story becomes: build the bot via Claude → operate the fleet via
dashboard → both shipped via one `npx -y mojulo` install. See
[lite-template/integration/UI_PACKAGE_PLAN.md](../lite-template/integration/UI_PACKAGE_PLAN.md).

### Added
- `mojulo-ui` bin — boots the bundled dashboard on a free local port and opens
  the browser ([scripts/mcp-ui.mjs](scripts/mcp-ui.mjs)). Flags: `--port <n>`,
  `--no-open`, `--help`. Binds 127.0.0.1 only. Shares `~/.mojulo/` state with
  the `mojulo` stdio bin, so a bot minted via MCP shows up immediately in the
  UI's fleet view.
- `version` MCP tool (Ring 0) — reports server version, MCP protocol version,
  Node version, platform os/arch, the pinned bot container image tag, the
  `MOJULO_OFFLINE_BUILD` flag, and the active `MOJULO_HOME`. Use to diagnose
  version mismatches between a user-reported issue and what their control
  plane is actually running.
- `inspect_bot_env` MCP tool (Ring 3) — read a bot's container `.env` safely.
  Returns `{ key, value, masked, valueLength? }` entries with sensitive values
  (Anthropic / OpenAI / AWS / Fly / GitHub / Slack tokens, and the
  auto-generated `MOJULO_API_KEY`) masked to first-4 + last-4. Non-sensitive
  entries (`LLM_PROVIDER`, ports, plain webhook URLs) come through clear.
  Takes either `deploymentId` (resolves under `MOJULO_HOME`) or an explicit
  `path` (basename must start with `.env`). The standing rule lives in the
  `initialize` preamble and the new "Secrets handling" section of
  `forward_context`: do not `cat`/`Read` `.env` files of mojulo bots — use this
  tool. Defense-in-depth: a recommended `.claude/settings.json` deny snippet
  is documented in `forward_context` so the harness can block the routine
  `cat .env` path even if an agent forgets the rule. Control-plane provider
  keys are unaffected — those already live encrypted in the `api_keys` table,
  managed via the `mojulo-config` CLI.
- `save_modular_bot` response now includes `artifactPath`, the absolute on-disk
  path to the compiled zip. Stdio MCP callers (which have no HTTP server to hit
  `downloadUrl` against) can surface this directly to the user.
- `open` runtime dep (~120 KB) — used only by the `mojulo-ui` shim for browser
  launch.

### Changed
- Next.js builds emit `output: 'standalone'`. The `mojulo-ui` bin imports the
  resulting `.next/standalone/server.js` directly; the pack ships the pruned
  standalone tree instead of the source app.
- `prepack` runs `stage-lite-template && next build --webpack`. The webpack
  build path is load-bearing — Turbopack's standalone output hashes external
  module names (e.g. `@huggingface/transformers-31f28a0eb9b916d1`), which
  Node's resolver can't find when standalone runs from inside `node_modules/`.
- `lite-template/` is bundled into the package again so the wizard preview
  routes (`/api/preview/bot/*`, `/api/preview/chat`, `/api/preview/extract`)
  resolve under bundled-`lite-template/` conditions. The `mojulo-ui` shim sets
  `LITE_TEMPLATE_PATH` to the bundled copy before booting the standalone
  server.
- `SERVER_VERSION` in the MCP `initialize` handshake reads from `package.json`
  via `getServerVersion()` instead of being a hardcoded constant. Both the
  `initialize` response and the new `version` tool will track future bumps
  automatically.
- `forward_context` tool index updated for the new `version` tool, the
  `artifactPath` field on `save_modular_bot`, and to steer stdio clients away
  from the legacy `downloadUrl` (which is a Next.js-route path, unreachable
  over stdio).
- `files` allowlist expanded with negations to exclude developer state from the
  pack: `.next/standalone/.env*`, `.next/standalone/data/**`,
  `.next/standalone/lib/embedder/models/**`, the duplicate
  `.next/standalone/lite-template/**`, stale `.tgz` artifacts, and test files
  inside the standalone bundle.

### Implementation notes
- Pack size moved from ~600 KB (0.1.0, stdio-only) to ~52 MB (0.2.0, includes
  Next.js standalone + lite-template + bundled deps). Webpack adds ~30 MB over
  the broken Turbopack pack but is the only build path that actually works
  from an `npm install` location.
- The bundled `lite-template/models/tokenizer.json` is 17 MB. Tokenizer cache
  sharing between the control-plane embedder and the bot-runtime embedder is
  deferred to v0.3.0 — currently each pulls from a different cache dir.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-19

Initial npm publish. Stdio-only MCP server for driving Mojulo bot design,
deploy, and operate workflows from Claude Code.

### Added
- `mojulo` bin — stdio MCP entrypoint ([scripts/mcp-stdio.mjs](scripts/mcp-stdio.mjs)).
- `mojulo-config` bin — config helper ([scripts/mcp-config.mjs](scripts/mcp-config.mjs)).
- Embedder cold-start: `preloadModel()` fires in the background on bin start so
  the first RAG bot mint avoids a cold ~113MB ONNX download.
- `LITE_TEMPLATE_PATH` env defaults to the bundled lite-template copy resolved
  at runtime from the install location.

### Changed
- `DockerDeployer` skips template file copying in prebuilt-image mode (the
  default). Previously it shipped `.gitignore` and test fixtures into every
  artifact. Offline-build mode (`MOJULO_OFFLINE_BUILD=1`) is unaffected.
- `TEMPLATE_EXCLUDES` excludes test and integration paths from offline-build
  artifacts.

### Removed
- `postinstall` hook. Model download is lazy on first use (with eager
  background preload on bin start) instead of running at `npm install` time.
