// ── characterization net (renderer-emitter.plan.md E2a) ────────────────────────────
// Hash-pins emitThreeWorld's emission for the whole fixture matrix. The E2b registry
// refactor must keep every hash IDENTICAL — that is the proof it is byte-pure. A hash
// here may only change when a plan step SAYS emission changes (and then the step's
// notes must name the fixtures it touched). To inspect a mismatch, dump both sides:
//   node -e "import('./lib/graph/scene/emit-fixtures.js').then(async ({EMIT_FIXTURES}) => {
//     const {emitThreeWorld} = await import('./lib/graph/scene/scene-three.js');
//     const fx = EMIT_FIXTURES.find(([n]) => n === '<name>');
//     process.stdout.write(emitThreeWorld(fx[1]));
//   })" > /tmp/emission.html
// and diff against the same dump from a clean checkout.
//
// Re-pinned 2026-10-07 (playscape: movers run rails and ride drives): the controllable runtime the page embeds gained
// the mover's `path` / `drive: 'ride'` branch and the carry pass's `_ridden` mark. The diff on the `controllable` fixture
// is additions only (85 lines, none removed); every fixture that embeds the controllable runtime re-pinned with it.
//
// Re-pinned 2026-10-07 (playscape: the catapult): the runtime gained the `launcher` rule, its `launch` world pass and
// `launch-lock` pre-step. On the `controllable` fixture 62 lines are added and 2 replaced: the rule registry names
// `launcher`, and the platform rule's jump cut skips a rider a launcher threw (`!e.launchedBy`, unset without one).
//
// Re-pinned 2026-10-07 (playscape: the ladder): the runtime gained the `climb` body owner (a platform body takes hold of
// a `climbable` entity, climbs it, mounts its lip, kicks off it). The diff on the `controllable` fixture is additions
// only (80 lines, none removed); a world without a climbable never takes hold.
//
// Re-pinned 2026-10-07 (playscape: breakable terrain and its gravity): the runtime gained the `breakables` state init,
// the `break` world pass (after the projectiles: hits, then the held set, the falls and the landings) and
// `breakBlock`. The diff on the `controllable` fixture is additions only (117 lines, none removed); a world without
// `breakables` keeps no breakable state and the pass returns at once.
